This bug is related to the usage of the `useTransition` hook in React 19 with concurrent rendering.  The problem arises when a transition is interrupted before it completes, leading to unexpected behavior in component updates. For example, if a transition starts fetching data and the user navigates away before the fetch completes, the component might not correctly reflect the new route's data, or might exhibit rendering glitches. This is because the interrupted transition's state might linger, interfering with subsequent renders.
